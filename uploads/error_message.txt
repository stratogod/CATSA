There was an error communicating with RHN.
RHN support will be disabled.

Error Message:
    Service not enabled for system profile: "umhc-stgprodl.umh.edu"
Error Class Code: 31
Error Class Info:
     This system does not have a valid entitlement for Red Hat Network.
     Please visit https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/systems/SystemEntitlements.do
     or login at https://rhn.redhat.com, and from the "Your RHN" tab,
     select "Subscription Management" to enable RHN service for this system.
Explanation:
    Your organization does not have enough Management entitlements to register this
    system to Red Hat Network. Please notify your organization administrator of this error.
    You should be able to register this system after your organization frees existing
    or purchases additional entitlements. Additional entitlements may be purchased by your
    organization administrator by logging into Red Hat Network and visiting
    the 'Subscription Management' page in the 'Your RHN' section of RHN.

    A common cause of this error code is due to having mistakenly setup an
    Activation Key which is set as the universal default.  If an activation key is set
    on the account as a universal default, you can disable this key and retry to avoid
    requiring a Management entitlement.
